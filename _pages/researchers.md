This section of the Intembeko ORCID Hub user guide demonstrates how a staff, student or researcher can connect their ORCID record to Intembeko and thus allowing your university to read and write information to your ORCID record.

To complete this process there are some actions required of you

1. login to Intembeko ORCID Hub with your university credentials
2. Once logged in, you will need to link your ORCID record to Intembeko

You can follow the links on the left and side of the page to start the process

3. Additionally if you dont have an ORCID record, you will need to create one. There is some screenshots on how to do this as well. This should be done before following steps 1 and 2 above. If you have an ORCID record already, you can skip this step

The image below demonstrates how Intembeko ORCID hub, your university and the permissions you allow all work together to allow information to be read and written to your ORCID record.
