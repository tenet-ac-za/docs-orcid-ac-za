### Step 5 

This will take you to the login ORCID sign in page where you will be asked to give permissions for the Intembeko ORCID hub to read and write information into your ORCID record. It is advised to allow these permissions as gives your university the ability to write affiliated information into the record, but also allows your university to read information set as trust party so that information can reused in university application forms and systems so that you do not have to retype this.

### Step 7

You can now log out of the hub.
If you now go to your ORCID record, you will see an affiliation writing by the Intembeko ORCID Hub (note the source of this information)
