Purpose of this guide
This guide describes how an organisation’s Technical Contact or designated Organisation
Administrator(s) can write affiliation information to ORCID records using the Intembeko ORCID Hub.

Prior to using the Intembeko ORCID Hub, your organisation must be onboarded to the application. If
your organisation is not listed [here](/hub/manual), your organisation’s ORCID Technical Contact
should request an invitation to onboard.
