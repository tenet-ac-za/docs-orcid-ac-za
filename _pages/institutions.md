This is the instutional admin section for the Intembeko ORCID hub.


Prior to using the Intembeko ORCID Hub, your organisation must be onboarded to the application.
Onboarding involves being authenticated in
the Hub, using the Hub to obtain API credentials for your organisation from ORCID, and entering
these into the Hub.

Your institution will also need to be participating in [South African Identity Federation (SAFIRE)](https://safire.ac.za)

A how to guide for some of the hub functions can be found [here](/hub/manual)
