This guide covers the use of the Intembeko ORCID Hub by organisations to assert employment and
education affiliations in ORCID records. Subsequent guides will cover funding, works and peer review,
with an additional guide for use of the Hub’s API.

This guide is intended for Intembeko ORCID consortium members’ Technical Contacts and, if
appointed, any Organisation Administrators that wish to use the Intembeko ORCID Hub to write to
the ORCID records of their affiliated researchers and contributors.

Technical contacts or designated Organisation Administrators can use the Intembeko ORCID Hub to
assert rich information that they verify as true and correct, about their organisation’s relationships in
the ORCID registry.

Prior to using the Intembeko ORCID Hub, your organisation must be onboarded to the application.
Onboarding involves being authenticated in
the Hub, using the Hub to obtain API credentials for your organisation from ORCID, and entering
these into the Hub.
